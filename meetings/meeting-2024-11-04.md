Status: Early Review  
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Implementation+Best+Practices%22)

Notes: Meeting notes of the last two meetings have been sent, minor changes effected from the latest version. In the last meeting, a request for comment had been made. Issues have been open. 
Issue 64 still open and hot, about refinements. https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/64. Formally, there is 

This issue is of particular relevance, because a gap in the current spec is identified (Simon, Joshua, Victor agree). Adding new triples to cover this would not harm the others (at least those prosent in today's call)
ACTION: To discuss in the next call whether new RDF triples should be discussed, in a "pull request basis". These RDF triples might encode new classes and properties that do not contradict the current spec but that are related to the formal semantics (@nicoletta, @rianella).
