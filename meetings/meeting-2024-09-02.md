## Agenda + Notes

#### 1. Working Drafts   

An informal conversation on different evaluation systems takes places. Reference is made to [Cedar Policies](https://www.cedarpolicy.com/en).
Joshua's implementation, in C#, includes partOf, memberOf... It treats policies as assets, enabling complex rules that refer to other rules.

#### 1.1 [ODRL Implementation Best Practices](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/bp/)
Owner: Victor  
Status: Early Review  
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Implementation+Best+Practices%22)  
Notes: No new examples have been created. Renato and Joshua discussed on refinements (https://github.com/w3c/poe/issues/312). The refinement of an action is clear to Joshua but some gaps have been identified (what about list of actions?). This issue may trigger new examples to clarify the point. When the issue is closed, please update the BP document.
 
#### 1.2 [ODRL Data Spaces Profile](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/profile-dataspaces/)
Owner: Joaquin  
Status: Under Development  
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Data+Spaces%22)  
Notes: No news given the summer break that just finished. The profile will be submitted to GaiaX, connectors are being produced.  

#### 1.3 [ODRL Temporal Profile](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/profile-temporal/)
Owner: Ben  
Status: Close to Review  
Open Issues: [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Temporal+Profile%22)  
Notes: Nothing to be reported.

#### 1.4 [ODRL Formal Semantics](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/)
Owner: Nicoletta  
Status: In Progress  
Open Issues: [Github](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Formal+Semantics%22)  
Notes: The formal semanticss [document](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/formal-semantics/) has been updated with the lifecycle of the duty. Fulfilled is no longer a final state, the evaluation is continuous and the state can fall back. A new example has been created (22.1) that clarifies constraint on a duty ("active only on sunday"). Others: please check example 22.1. The semantic of prohibition has been updated as well, aligning with the ODRL [information model](https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/). 
Yassir would like to see more complex examples and hints to see how to make the evaluation --a compliance engine to test the implementation would be greatly appreciated. 

#### 1.5 [ODRL Community Vocabulary](https://w3c.github.io/odrl/community-vocab/)
Owner: Beatriz  
Status: New  
Open Issues: [Github Issues](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Community+Vocabulary%22)   
Notes: Beatriz was not pressent in the call.
