  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Status of this Draft: Open to Public Reviews And Comments</strong></p>
    <p>The ODRL CG is active on this draft, reviewed and improved the content multiple times. <br> 
    Now the ODRL CG invites any party interested in creating an ODRL Policy to use this draft as blueprint for their work and to provide feedback on these topics: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>What information is missing?</li>
      <li>What information is unclear (missing details, contradictions inside the document, contradictions between the ODRL 2.2 Recommendation and this Best Practice document)?</li>
      <li>What information, including examples, would you like to see?</li>
      <li>What did you like in this document?</li>
      <li>The CG would be happy to receive the latest draft of your ODRL Profile.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Please post your feedback as Issue to the <a href="https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues">ODRL Github repository</a> OR to the <a href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-odrl/">public ODRL email list</a> (you have to subscribe).</p>
  </div>
  <p>The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) 2.2 defines an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model">Information Model</a> for expressing policies which requires classes and concepts
    for its assertions. A basic set of classes and concepts is defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#vocab-core">ODRL Core Vocabulary</a> and the information model permits users of ODRL to define their own subclasses and concepts for a specific use.</p>
  <p>Specific sets of classes and concepts are named as ODRL Profile and a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile">full chapter</a> of
    the information model recommendation covers its purpose, required conformance
    and a mechanism for creating new ones.</p>
  <p>This document walks users through the ODRL Profile chapter, explains
    how to implement a Profile and provides some examples.Â  A user planning
    to create an ODRL Profile should start with reading the section about
    the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile-motivation">purpose
    of an ODRL Profile</a>.</p>

  <h2>What an ODRL Profile can define</h2>
  <p>This section walks through the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile-mechanism">ODRL
    Profile Mechanism</a> of the ODRL Information Model. All items below, except the last one, are about adding an ODRL-related specification. Such a specification does not become part of the ODRL 2.2 Recommendation but an ODRL Processor processing ODRL Policies with a specific Profile must be able to understand this Profile's specification.</p>
  <p>The seqence of additional specifications follows priorities of use expected by the ODRL Community Group.</p>
  <section id="action">    
  <h3>Additional Actions for Rules</h3>
  <p>An instance of ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-Action">Action </a>is used as value of the mandatory property <code>action </code>of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Rule</a> class, and all its subclasses Permission, Prohibition and Duty (and ones defined by a Profile). The
    Recommendation defines only two instances of Action: <code>use</code>, covering any
    use of an asset while the ownership of the asset does not change, and <code>transfer</code>,
    covering the transfer of the ownership of an asset in perpetuity.</p>
  <p>If these two core Actions are sufficient, a Profile does not need to add
    more. But in most cases, additional Action instances are required, and the example
    shows how to add two to the Example Profile 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>digitize </code>is an Action already <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-digitize">defined </a>by the ODRL Common Vocabulary. But this Common Vocabulary is not
      part of the ODRL Recommendation; therefore, Actions defined by it must
      be adopted by the Example Profile 1. <br>
      Note: an Action defined by the ODRL Common Vocabulary does not have to be included into the specification of a Profile, it is only required to express that it is included into the Profile. Find more about that in 
    Resources defining an ODRL Profile.</li>
    <li><code>changecolours </code>is an Action defined for and by this
      Example Profile 1</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Additional Constraint Left Operands</h3>
  <p>An ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-class">Constraint </a>is a class for applying a constraint to a Rule. One of its
    mandatory properties is <code>leftOperand</code> and instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-LeftOperand">Left
    Operand</a> are used as values of this property, the Recommendation does not define any instances.</p>
  <p>If any Constraint will be used for a Policy using a specific Profile, at
    least one Left Operand must be defined for the mandatory leftOperand
    property. The example shows how to define two for the Example Profile 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>elapsedTime </code>is a LeftOperand already <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-elapsedTime">defined </a>by the ODRL Common Vocabulary. But this Common Vocabulary is not
      part of the ODRL Recommendation; therefore, LeftOperands defined by it
      must be adopted by the Example Profile 1<br>
      Note: a LeftOperand defined by the ODRL Common Vocabulary does not have to be included into the specification of a Profile, it is only required to express that it is included into the Profile. Find more about that in 
    Resources defining an ODRL Profile.    </li>
    <li><code>aggregatedTime </code>is a LeftOperand defined by the Example
      Profile 1</li>

  <h3>Additional Constraint Operators</h3>
  <p>An ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-class">Constraint </a>is a class for applying a constraint to a Rule. One of its
  mandatory properties is <code>operator</code> and instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-Operator">Operator</a> are used as values of this property, the Recommendation <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#constraintRelationalOperators">defines</a> 12 instances.</p>

  <h3>Additional Party Functions</h3>
  <p>An instance of ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#partyRoles">Party
    Function</a> is used as value of the property <code>function </code>of the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Rule</a> class, the Recommendation defines 14 instances. <code>function</code> sets the
    relationship between a subclass of a Rule (Permission, Prohibition,
    Duty, ...) and a Party or a PartyCollection.</p>
  <p>The example shows how to define the Party Function <code> toBeNotifiedParty </code>for the Example Profile 1, a party which
    must be notified in the context of executing the action of a Rule. </p>
  <div class="example">
    <div class="example-title marker"><span>Example 4 (TTL)</span></div>

  <h3>Additional Asset Relationships</h3>
  <p>An ODRL Asset Relationship is a relationship between a subclass of a
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Rule</a> (Permission, Prohibition, Duty, ...) and an Asset, the Recommendation <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-relation">defines </a>only <code> target </code> as sub-property of <code>relation</code>.</p>
  <p>The example shows how to define the asset relationship <code>input </code>for
    the Example Profile 1, an asset required as input for the action of a
    Rule.</p>

  <h3>Additional Constraint Right Operands</h3>
  <p>An ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-class">Constraint </a>is a class for applying a constraint to a Rule. One of its
    mandatory properties is <code>rightOperand</code> (or its alternative <code>rightOperandReference</code>)
    and instances of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-RightOperand">RightOperand </a>are used as value of this property, the Recommendation does not define any. </p>
  <p>If any Constraint will be used for a Policy using a specific Profile, it
    may be required to define one or more RightsOperands. The example shows
    how to define one for the Example Profile 1:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><code>policyUsage </code>is a RightOperand already <a href="%C2%B4https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-policyUsage">defined </a>by the ODRL Common Vocabulary. But this Common Vocabulary is not
      part of the ODRL Recommendation; therefore, RightOperands defined by it

  <h3>Additional Logical Constraints operands</h3>
  <p>An ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-logical">Logical
    Constraint</a> is a class for applying a constraint to a Rule. One of
    its properties must be a sub-property of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#term-operand">operand
    property</a>, the Recommendation <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#constraintLogicalOperands">defines

  <h3>Additional Rule Subclasses</h3>
  <p>The ODRL Information Model Recommendation defines the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#rule">Rule
    Class</a> and three subclasses of it: the Permission Class, the Prohibition Class and the Duty Class. The ODRL Profile Mechanism permits to create additional subclassesof the Rule Class or of one of these defined subclasses; their definitions must comply with the
    design of the basic Rule Class. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have one <code>action</code> property value of type Action.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none or one <code><em>relation</em></code> sub-property values of type Asset.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one or
      many <code><em>function</em></code> sub-property values of type
      Party.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one or
      many <code><em>failure</em></code> sub-property values of type Rule.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one or
      many <code>constraint</code> property values of type
      Constraint/LogicalConstraint.</li>
    <li>A Rule <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none or one <code>uid</code> property values (of type IRI [<cite><a class="bibref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#bib-rfc3987">rfc3987</a></cite>])
      to identify the Rule so it <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> be referenced by other Rules.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Defining a subclass of Rule or of Permission or of Prohibition or of Duty allows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the cardinality of a property is defined by its superclass as &quot;MAY have none or one&quot; a &quot;MUST have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST NOT have one&quot; can be defined.</li>
    <li>If the cardinality of a property is defined by its superclass as &quot;MAY have none, one or many&quot; a &quot;MUST have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST NOT have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST have many&quot; can be defined.</li>
    <li>One or more additional properties may be defined. For a property its name (identifier), its occurrence and its value type must be defined.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="note">
    <p><strong>Design Strategy</strong></p>
    <p>The ODRL Community Group highly recommends for Profiles to stick to the basic design of Rule subclasses as defined by the ODRL Information Model: the Rule subclasses Permission, Prohibition and Duty cover the key use cases of an ODRL policy and therefore an ODRL Profile should either adopt any of these three classes as they are or define subclasses of the Permission Class, or the Prohibition Class or the Duty Class. Defining a subclass of Rule should be avoided as this may infringe the information model of ODRL. </p>
    <p><strong>Design Consideration</strong><br>Please check if a rule required by the use case covered by the Profile can be expressed - in this sequence: <br>1) By the Permission, the Prohibition or the Duty class as defined by ODRL Recommendation (this does not need a definition by a Profile)<br>2) By a new subclass of the Permission or Prohibition or Duty class (the new subclass(es) must be defined by the Profile)<br>3) As a last resort: by a subclass of the Rule class as defined by the ODRL Recommendation as none of the items above fits the needs of the use case. (The new subclass(es) of Rule and a new subclass of Policy with a property for each new Rule subclass must be defined by the Profile.)</p>  
    <p><strong>How To Define a Subclass of the Permission Class</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>A new subclass of Permission is defined by the Profile ...</li>
      <li>... this new subclass can be used with the permission property of the Policy class as defined by the ODRL Recommendation</li>
      <li>The generic rules of the Rule class for the use of properties are refined by specific rules of the Permission Class:
        <ul>
          <li>A Permission <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have one <code>target</code> property value of type Asset. (Other <code><i>relation</i></code> sub-properties <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> be used.)</li>
          <li>A Permission <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none or one <code>assigner</code> and/or <code>assignee</code> property values (of type Party) for functional roles. (Other <code><i>function</i></code> sub-properties  <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> be used.)</li>
          <li>A Permission <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one, or more <code>duty</code> property values of type Duty.</li>

  <h3>Additional Policy Subclasses</h3>
  <p>The ODRL Information Model Recommendation defines the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#policy">Policy
    Class</a> and three subclasses of it: the Set Class, the Offer Class
    and the Agreement Class. The ODRL Profile Mechanism permits to create
    additional subclasses; their definitions must comply with the design of the
    basic Policy Class:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Policy <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have one <code>uid</code> property value (of type IRI [<cite><a class="bibref" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#bib-rfc3987">rfc3987</a></cite>])
      to identify the Policy. <br />
      A subclass must adopt this rule.</li>
    <li>A Policy <em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have at least
      one <code>permission</code>, <code>prohibition</code>, or <code>obligation</code> property values of type Rule.<br />
      A subclass can combine any set of one <code>permission</code>, <code>prohibition</code>,
      or <code>obligation</code> property values as long as this basic rule
      is satisfied.<br />
      Examples:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Only <code>permission </code>property values</li>
      <li>Only <code>permission </code>property values, five as maximum</li>
      <li>Only <code>permission </code>or <code>prohibition </code>property
        values</li>
      <li>Only at least 1 <code>permission </code>and at least 1Â  <code>prohibition </code>property value</li>
    </ul>
    <li>A Policy <em class="rfc2119" title="MAY">MAY</em> have none, one,
      or many <code>profile</code> property values.<br />
      This is an implicitly met requirement: if a Profile is defined it must
      be expressed by a <code>profile </code>property values to become
      effective.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A new Policy subclass must be defined as disjoint with all other Policy
    subclasses, except the Set subclass.</p>
  <p>Defining a subclass of Policy allows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If the cardinality of a property is defined by the Policy class as &quot;MAY have none or one&quot; a &quot;MUST have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST NOT have one&quot; can be defined.</li>
    <li>If the cardinality of a property is defined by the Policy class as &quot;MAY have none, one or many&quot; a &quot;MUST have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST NOT have one&quot; or a &quot;MUST have many&quot; can be defined.</li>
    <li>If the Policy class defines &quot;<em class="rfc2119" title="MUST">MUST</em> have at least
    one&quot; with a list of properties to select from a restricted set of properties and/or a specific combination of properties can be defined. (See the examples for <code>permission</code>, <code>prohibition</code>, or <code>obligation</code> property values above.)</li>
    <li>One or more additional properties may be defined. For a property its name (identifier), its occurrence and its value type must be defined.</li>
  </ul>

    <h3>How to use multiple Profiles in a single Policy</h3>
    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#policy">Policy</a> class defines for the <code>profile</code> property that none, one or many profile identifiers can be applied. This raises the question: what should be considered if more than one Profile is applied to an instance of a Policy:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>First it should be considered that applying only one profile identifier to the <code>profile</code> property means that two profiles are in use: the default <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile-core">ODRL Core Profile</a> and this explicitly defined profile.</li>
      <li>Subclasses, sub-properties or instances of a class included into a Profile are defined in either a specific namespace  or in the ODRL namespace if this thing is defined already by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#vocab-common">ODRL Common Vocabulary</a>.</li>
      <li>Subclasses, sub-properties or instances of a class defined in a namespace used for e.g., Example Profil 1 can also be adopted for another Profile, e.g., Example Profile 2. (Note: be aware that the identifier of a Profile and the identifer of a namespace used by it does not have to the same.)</li>
      <li>If a subclasses, sub-properties or instances of a class is defined in a namespace with an identifier different from the identifier of the Profile this thing can be used by multiple Profiles (with identifiers different from the namespace) but they MUST be defined by each Profile in exactly the same way. E.g., a Rule subclass exns1:StraightPermission defined by Example Profile 1 as not having any property expressing a Duty must not have in a definition of Example Profile 2 a property expressing a Duty.<br>
        Note: for this purpose this Best Practices document uses the term &quot;adopt&quot; for including the definition of a thing which may be included by other Profiles. In particular, this term was used for things defined by the ODRL Common Vocabulary is a use of things defined by it by other Profiles has to be expected.
      </li>
      <li>For using a thing defined by Example Profile 1 by a Policy using Example Profile 2 it is not strictly required to adopt this thing of Example Profile 1 for Example Profile 2; formally it is sufficient to apply the identifiers for Example Profile 2 and of Example Profile 1 to the <code>profile</code> property of the Policy.</li>
      <li>If multiple identifiers of Profiles are applied to the <code>profile</code> property of the Policy all the things defined by all of them are valid for this Policy. If only subsets of the things defined by multiple Profiles should be applied to a Policy, a new Profile should be created adopting only the things of this subset.</li>
      <li>If Party A defines a Profile with things defined by (and in a namespace of) Party B, the adoption must comply with the copyright of these things.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>What the Core Profile does not define</h2>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile-motivation">ODRL Profile Purpose</a> section of the ODRL Information Model defines the roles of profiles: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The ODRL Core Profile defines a vocabulary of all the terms defined by the ODRL Information Model 2.2. Recommendation</li>
    <li>All other profiles defined by the rules of an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#profile">ODRL Profile</a> must be considered as a definition of additional terms</li>
  </ul>

    <p>But it is not mandatory to use all terms of the ODRL Core Profile and of a referenced additional profile in an ODRL Policy instance.
    <br>Based on this basic rule, a profile may suggest to ignore a term defined by the ODRL Core Profile, e.g. a specific subclass of Policy or Rule, a specific instance of Action, a specific Logical Constraint Operand ... and others, which is not relevant for the use case covered by this profile as long as the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model">ODRL Information Model</a> does not define its use as mandatory, as a MUST. (Check the terms defined by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#vocab-core">ODRL Core Vocabulary</a>.) But a profile must not declare an ODRL Core Profile term as prohibited, as MUST NOT be used!
    </p>
  <section id="oos1">    
  <h3>What may be ignored, and what not</h3>
  <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model">ODRL Information Model</a> claims the use of properties of a class as a MUST (= as mandatory) or that an ODRL Validator MUST support the use of specific sub-properties of a defined property. A validator supporting the ODRL Core Profile and a specific additional profile MUST NOT ignore mandatory ODRL Core requirements but in reverse it may ignore optional ODRL Core requirements.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Regarding Policy: a subclass of Policy must be used, but it is not mandatory to use a subclass defined by the ODRL Core Profile if a related profile defines one. Therefore the subclasses of Policy defined by the ODRL Core Profile may be ignored if the related profile defines a new subclass of Policy.</li>
    <li>Regarding the Rule(s) of a Policy: <br>A Policy must use at least one of the properties permission, prohibition or obligation with a corresponding subclass of Rule - Permission Class, or a subclass of it; Prohibition Class, or a subclass of it; Duty Class or a subclass of it - as type, this cannot be omitted.</li>
    <li>Regarding Action: the ODRL Core Profile defines only <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#actions">two instances of Action</a>: use and transfer. A profile may ignore them as using them and their narrower terms is not defined as mandatory by the Rule Class or the Action Class.</li>
    <li>Regarding Party Functions: The Rule Class defines the use of sub-properties of <code>function</code> as optional, it may be ignored. But if a sub-property of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#function">function property</a> is used, the two terms defined by the ODRL Core Profile, <code>assigner</code> and <code>assignee</code>, must not be ignored.</li>
    <li>Regarding Asset Relationship: The Rule Class defines the use of sub-properties of <code>relation</code> as optional, it may be ignored. But if a sub-property of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#relation">relation property</a> is used the single term defined by the ODRL Core Profile, <code>target</code>, must not be ignored.</li>

  <h2>Prerequisites for defining an ODRL Profile</h2>
  <section id="guid">      
  <h3>A globally uniqe identifier of the Profile</h3>
  <p>Each Profile must have a globally unique identifer. 
    Such an identifier 
  must be of type IRI [<a href="#bib-rfc3987">rfc3987</a>] which is in short a URI [<a href="#bib-rfc3986">rfc3986</a>] with an extended, internationalized character set.</p>
  <p>Be aware that this Profile identifier should not be used for other purposes like the identifier of a namespace of concepts defined by the Profile as it would be hard to distinguish if a profile or a namespace is identified when using this identifier.  </p>
  </section>
  <section id="webresource">
    <h3>The Profile as a stable web resource</h3>
  <p>If a Profile should be used publicly, its definition and optional usage guidelines should be publicly accessible web resources. Consider defining the unique identifier of the Profile as URL of a web resource providing information about the Profile.</p>
  </section>
  <section id="addlspecs">      
  <h3>Generating additional specifications of this Profile</h3>
  <p>This section covers the procedure of generating specifications in addition to the ODRL Core Profile, details of documents resulting from this procedure are covered in <a href="#profdef">section 5</a>, and <a href="#pubavail">section 6</a> covers how to make them publicly available.</p>
  <p>A Profile should have a semantic technology specification using a SKOS Collection [<a href="#bib-skos">skos</a>] and making all concepts adopted or created by this Profile a member of this Collection. Use the IRI of the Profile as identifier of this Collection.</p>
  <p><a href="#scope">Section 3</a> explains what a new ODRL Profile can define in addition to the Core Profile. Walking through this section should result in this output:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If a concept from the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#vocab-common">ODRL Common Vocabulary</a> is adopted, it should not be specified by this Profile, but it must be made a member of the Profile's Collection.</li>
    <li>If an existing concept conforming to ODRL 2.2 specifications from a source different from this Profile is adopted: check first if a specification of this concept is publicly accessible. If this is the case this concept should be adopted by adding it as member to the Profile's Collection. If this is not the case it has to be specified like a new concept defined by this Profile, see next item.</li>
    <li>If a new concept is created for this Profile, it must be specified by the documents of this Profile and made a member of the Profile's Collection.</li>
    <li>If a concept is adopted or created as ODRL Action, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Actions defined by this Profile. </li>
    <li>If a concept is adopted or created as ODRL Constraint Left Operand, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Constraint Left Operands defined by this Profile. </li>
    <li>If a concept is adopted or created as ODRL Constraint Operator, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Constraint Operators defined by this Profile.</li>
    <li>If a concept is adopted or created as ODRL Party Function, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Party Functions defined by this Profile.</li>
    <li>If a concept is adopted or created as ODRL Asset Relationship, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Asset Relationships defined by this Profile.</li>
    <li>If a concept is adopted or created as ODRL Constraint Right Operand, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Constraint Right Operands defined by this Profile.</li>
    <li>If a concept is adopted or created as ODRL Logical Constraint, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Logical Constraints defined by this Profile.</li>
    <li>If a concept is adopted or created as ODRL Policy Conflict Strategy Preference, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Policy Conflict Strategy Preferences defined by this Profile.</li>
    <li>If a subclass is adopted or created as ODRL Rule subclass, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Rule subclasses defined by this Profile.</li>
    <li>If a subclass is adopted or created as ODRL Policy subclass, it should be made a member of a SKOS Collection of all Policy subclasses defined by this Profile.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Finally: create a W3C Profile Vocabulary [<a href="#bib-dxprof">dx-prof</a>] document. This document sets the normative part of the ODRL Profile - the ODRL 2.2 Information Model and the ODRL 2.2 Core Profile - and lists all documents used for defining this Profile.  </p>

  <section id="owlontology">      
  <h3>OWL Ontology</h3>
  <p>An OWL [<a href="#bib-owl">owl</a>] Ontology should define all concepts defined by a Profile, each one's properties and relationships. Different formats can be applied, these are the most widely used: RDF Turtle, RDF/XML, RDF N-Triples, JSON-LD.<br>
    This ontology should include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A definition of all used prefixes, if the used syntax supports or requires that.</li>
    <li>A definition of the ontology as a whole. As identifier of the ontology, the identifier of the Profile must be used.</li>
    <li>A SKOS [<a href="#bib-skos">skos</a>] Collection of all concepts defined by this Profile, either a concept specified by this ontology or a concept defined by another source.</li>
    <li>A SKOS Collection for each type of additional concepts or subclasses (see <a href="#scope">section 3</a>) if at least one concept is defined for it.</li>
    <li>A declaration of all used annotation properties to keep this ontology within OWL DL.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>See below an example ontology of the (virtual) ODRL <em>Profile Example Profile 1</em>.<br>
    It adopts a small set of concepts defined by the ODRL Common Vocabulary and specifies a single concepts on its own.

  <h3>W3C Profile Vocabulary</h3>
  <p>A W3C Profile Vocabulary [<a href="#bib-dxprof">dx-prof</a>] asserts all resources - named as artifacts - which are relevant for a Profile:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The base of any ODRL Policy, the W3C ODRL 2.2 Recommendation and its resources:
      <ul>
        <li>the specification (HTML) document</li>
        <li>the Core Profile</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>The Profile and its resources:
      <ul>
        <li>the specification (HTML) document </li>
        <li>the OWL ontology</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    </ul>
  <p>This provides a quick overview like the example below for the (virtual) ODRL <em>Profile Example Profile 1</em>.</p>

  <h3>JSON-LD context document </h3>
  <p>Whether the OWL Ontology of a Profile uses JSON-LD [<a href="#bib-jsonld">JSON-LD</a>] as format or if an ODRL Policy is expressed as JSON-LD, the uses of a JSON-LD Context is highly recommended. It is used for mapping short-term aliases of concept identifiers to the original identifier.</p>

  <h2>Making an ODRL Profile publicly available</h2>
  <p> If an ODRL Profile should be used by a public audience, it is highly recommended to make its specifications publicly accessible:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A human-readable specification as an HTML web document</li>
    <li>An OWL Ontology as resource using a common Semantic Web format, like RDF/Turtle, RDF/XML, RDF/N-Triples, or JSON-LD</li>
    <li>A resource using the W3C Profile Vocabulary in a common Semantic Web format, like RDF/Turtle, RDF/XML, RDF/N-Triples, or JSON-LD</li>
    <li>If the JSON-LD form should be supported for ODRL Policies, a JSON-LD Context resource.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>All these resourced can be made accessible by URLs.</p>
  <p>An alternative option is based on http request-based content negotiation; this feature must be supported by the web server delivering the documents. In this case, a generic URL is defined for the human-readable HTML document and the OWL Ontology in Semantic Web formats. Depending on the IANA Media Type expressed by the accept-header of the http(s) request the corresponding resource is delivered by the http(s) response.</p>
  <p>The URL(s) used for such resources should be persistent over time. The publisher of a Profile should consider whether to reflect the version of the Profile in the URL or to use version-agnostic URLs.</p>
