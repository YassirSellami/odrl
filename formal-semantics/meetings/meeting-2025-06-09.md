#119 The ODRL Evaluator consider a single policy at a time. The Semantics of ODRL web page has been modified accordingly. Solved.
Section 1
"More precisely, the ODRL Evaluator uses as input: an ODRL Policy;"

#120 Methodology to propose one interpretation of an ODRL Policy. The Semantics of ODRL web page has been modified accordingly. Solved.
Section 2
"Before providing the semantics of an ODRL Policy that may contain one or more Rules, we have to provide the semantics of the different types of ODRL Rules: Permission, Prohibition, and Obligation.

Our approach in providing the semantics of an ODRL Policy is first to reach agreement, inside the ODRL Community Group, on the output of the ODRL Evaluator for different types of ODRL rules and then to generalise that output."

#121 Arrangement of examples in the best practices github folder 
Plese have a look to the [pull request](https://github.com/w3c/odrl/pull/127/files) and provide feedbacks.

#123 Default behaviour of the Evaluator. We will continue the discussion during next meeting.
