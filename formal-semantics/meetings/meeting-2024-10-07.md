## Agenda + Notes

#### 1. Compliance Report Model

Wout Slabbinck presents the compliance report model. See slides in the mailing list. 
An ODRL example plus SOLID is presented. [2024.10.policyreport.png See this figure.]
Discussion on the ODRL evaluator, the test suite, a demo and future work follows
There is a repo, but not yet public.
Levels of compliance needed. 

Ben: sync/async evaluation is relevant. Different components check different parts of the policy, and synching these answers is relevant.
For example, payment information is (very) asynchronous.

Simon: the implemenation based on ASP naturally solves some problems.
Another verification: I do not always want to exercise my right. I just want to learn what is missing to have permission.
