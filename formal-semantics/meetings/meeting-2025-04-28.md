## Notes

We closed issue #66 on the semantics of count because it is covered by the new issue #107

We discussed issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/61">#61</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/68">#68</a> on the state of the world used as input of the ODRL Evaluator.

The following observations/proposals emerged:

<ul>
  <li>Define an <b>ontology</b> for describing the state of the world;</li>
  <li>Start from a list of <b>use cases</b> that we want to cover;</li>
  <li></li>Do we want to keep track of a history of states each one having a different time stamp?</li>
  <li>The ODRL Evaluator needs to consider only <b>relevant parts</b> of the state of the world</li>
  <li>Regarding the use of the ODRL Evaluator on different scenarios (e.g. access control and usage control)
  it is crucial to represent in a different way <b>performed, requested, and attempted actions</b></li>
  
  
</ul>
