## Notes

We closed issue #66 on the semantics of count because it is covered by the new issue #107

We discussed issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/61">#61</a> and 
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/68">#68</a> on the <b>state of the world</b> used as input of the ODRL Evaluator.

The following observations/proposals emerged:

<ul>
  <li>Define an <b>ontology</b> for describing the state of the world;</li>
  <li>Start from a list of <b>use cases</b> that we want to cover;</li>
  <li>Do we want to keep track of a history of states each one having a different time stamp?</li>
  <li>The ODRL Evaluator needs to consider only <b>relevant parts</b> of the state of the world</li>
  <li>Regarding the use of the ODRL Evaluator on different scenarios (e.g. access control and usage control)
  it is crucial to represent in a different way <b>performed, requested, and attempted actions</b></li>
  <li>Together with the state of the world the ODRL Evaluator may need as input a representation of the specific action (requested, attempted, performed) on which the ODRL Evaluator has to provide an output. 
It is better to avoud to use the odrl:Request subclass of odrl:Policy for representing a request to perform an action, because in https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/ODRL22.ttl an odrl:Request is defined as "skos:definition "A Policy that proposes a Rule over an Asset from an assignee." i.e. it is an offer of a Rule.</li>
<li>Beatriz will prepare a document with a first draft of a representation of the state of the world.</li>
</ul>

We plan to discuss other issues (if it is possible) during next ODRL meeting on 5th of May (next Monday).

We plan to meet again on Monday 19th May 2025 2 p.m. CEST.
