## Agenda + Notes

#### 1. On the different implements

Beatriz comments a paper is to be submitted in December. Slides were sent to the list. 
Andrea has also a paper, with much details for the evaluation of constraints. No support for the policy monitoring, only access control. 
Joshua comments on the implementation, for financial information, with many different policies for different use cases. 
Different aspects of each implementations are commented.
Victor claims we should orderly follow the issues list, inviting all to make their claims explicit: (i) specific changes to be made on the current spec, 
(ii) more examples to enrich the expected behaviour of the ODRL evaluator and (iii) ideas for the next major revision of ODRL. 
General agreement (Yassir particularly stressed the need for more examples of state-of-the-world+request+policy = result).

Nicoletta makes a call for all to comment on the existing text and propose changes and improvements.
