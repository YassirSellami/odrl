## Notes

The goal was to discuss the input and output of the ODRL Evaluator.

First input of the ODRL Evaluator: the <b>State of the World</b> (issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/61">#61</a> and issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/68">#68</a>).

Beatriz created a first draft of the State of the World available at https://spec.knows.idlab.ugent.be/sotw/latest/

The following observations emerged:

<ul>
  <li>Define an ontology.</li>
  <li>Represent the performed actions separated from the actions described in the policy. The performed actions have a instant of time or a time interval when they were performed.</li>
  <li>For representing the properties of the actions may be it is necessary to use the ODRL vocabulary.</li>
 <li>Introduce a section for recommendations like ISO</li>
  <li>Other crucial comments in the last meeting notes https://github.com/w3c/odrl/blob/master/formal-semantics/meetings/meeting-2025-04-28.md</li>
</ul>

Second input of the ODRL Evaluator: the action on which a rule inside a policy must be evaluated. For the access control scenario it is the requested action.

- In issue <a href="https://github.com/w3c/odrl/issues/93">#93</a> there is a proposal.

- In other approaches the ODRL:Request is used: the advantage of this solution is that the ODRL Vocabulary can be reused to describe actions.

Decision: a subgroup will work on the State of the World ontology starting from the real examples and the examples in the ODRL Formal Semantics document.

Next meetings:
- Beatriz will organize a meeting on the definition of the ontology of the state of the world.

- 1st June OPAL 2025 Workshop (https://opal-workshop.github.io/2025/).

- 9th June ODRL general meeting.
