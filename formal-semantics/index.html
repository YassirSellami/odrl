            <h2>Introduction</h2> 	
            <p> <!-- definition of ODRL -->
                    The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a policy expression language that can be used to represent permitted, prohibited, and obligated actions over a certain asset. 
            </p>
            <p> <!-- reference of official ODRL-documents -->
                    The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#infoModel">ODRL Information Model</a> formally defines the core abstract concepts of the model and their properties by means of an OWL 2 Ontology (available at <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/">https://www.w3.org/ns/odrl/2/</a>), which is described in the ODRL <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/">Vocabulary & Expression</a> specification.	
            </p>
            <p> <!-- the use of ontologies -->
                    The ODRL ontology can be used as a data model to represent machine-readable Policies and associate them with digital or analog assets. By using a machine-readable language to represent policies, ODRL implementations can provide useful functionalities such as those of a policy search engine, a policy compatibility checker, an access control system, a monitoring system, or a policy planning system, among others.
            </p
            <p> <!-- the need for clarifying the semantics, the need for this document -->
		    
However, neither the specification of the model (in a text form) nor the vocabulary (in an OWL ontology) accurately describes the behaviour of an <b>ODRL Evaluator</b>. 

<!-- objective of the evaluator -->
The objective of an <b>ODRL Evaluator</b> is to determine as output: 
<ul>
  <li>which Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations (collectively named Rules) are <b>active</b> in a given instant of time. 
  A Rule is said to be active if it is in effect;</li>
  <!--<li>which Permissions have been <b>used</b>;</li>-->
  <li>which Prohibitions and Obligations have been <b>violated</b> or <b>fulfilled</b>.</li>
</ul>

This document describes the expected behaviour of an ODRL Evaluator, with a textual description and a collection of examples.
This specification owes much to the previous description in the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2016/poe/wiki/Evaluator">wiki</a>.</p>
	
<p> <!-- definition of the evaluator -->
When the <b>ODRL Evaluator</b> evaluates Permissions, it is expected to work in at least one of these two scenarios:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Access control scenario</b>: the ODRL Evaluator determines the access by users or software agents to digital resources
            considering a set of policies, the state of the world, and the description of the action that a user 
            attempts to perform on certain digital resources.</li>

            <li><b>Policy monitoring scenario</b> (or compliance checking): given a set of policies and the description of the state of the world that includes the performed actions,
            the ODRL Evaluator has to determine whether obligations or prohibitions have been fulfilled or violated by the performance of 
            certain actions, and which permissions are active.</li>
        </ol>

<p> 
More precisely, the Evaluator uses as input:
</p>
<ul> <!-- input of the Evaluator -->
  <li>a collection of ODRL Policies;</li>
  <li>a formal description of the state of the world;</li>
  <li>for the access control scenario: a formal description of the action attempted by a given user who is located in a given place;</li>
</ul>

        <p><!-- state of the world --> 
            The ODRL Evaluator requires a formal representation of the <b>state of the world</b> to perform computations on both 
            the access control and the policy monitoring scenarios. This state of the world may include current date, 
            current location of the assignee or the history of performed actions. 
            This document does not formally specify how to represent the necessary entities (e.g. country codes). 
            The formal representation of the world can be a set of RDF triples. 
            The existence of these triples does not entail their represented world is a reality: the <i>factuality</i> of the 
            class instances is not entailed, and hypothetical computations are possible. 
            The implementor of the ODRL Evaluator may want to describe the factuality of relevant class instances. 
            RDF triples to represent the state of the world may be generated as observations from the world generated by third parties (extrinsic), 
            by the ODRL Evaluator user or by any other source (intrinsic). Some examples of these state of the world RDF triples are:
        </p>
        <ul> <!-- examples of the state of the world -->
            <li><b>Current Time</b>: a unit of time that represents the current time of the state of the world.</li>
            <li><b>Time Range</b>: a tuple of time values that represent a start and an end.</li>
            <li><b>List of Languages</b>: a sequence of languages from a taxonomy (e.g. <a href="https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-code#">iso639</a>).</li>
            <li><b>Executed actions</b>: a collection of executed actions.</li>
            <li><b>Parties</b>: parties involved in a given state that have a <code>odrl:function</code> within the policies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> <!-- attempted actions in the state of the world as rdf --> 
            Regarding actions, we assume that attempted or executed <b>actions</b> are described in RDF by specifying at least:
        </p>
        <ul> <!-- examples of attempted actions in the state of the world -->
            <li>its <code>type</code> (a list of actions types is available in the 
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-vocab/#actionsCommon">ODRL Common Vocabulary</a>); </li>
            <li>the agent who is the <code>performer</code> of the action;</li>	
            <li>the <code>object</code> upon which the action is carried out;</li>	
            <li>the instant of time at which the action occurs or begins, it is represented with the <code>atTime</code> property.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="sectionPolicies">	
        <h2>Semantics of Policies</h2>	
        <p> <!-- Subclasses of policies -->
            There are three ODRL Policy subclasses (Agreement, Offer, Set), plus four non-normative ODRL Policy subclasses (Assertion, Privacy, Request, Ticket). Direct instances of the <code>odrl:Policy</code> class must be understood as policy <code>odrl:Set</code> policies. This subsection describes how are these policies to be understood in relation to semantics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A <code>odrl:Set</code> policy must be considered by an ODRL Evaluator. The <code>odrl:Set</code> is not necessarily linked to <code>odrl:Offer</code> nor <code>odrl:Agreement</code>.<br></li>
            <li>An <code>odrl:Offer</code> policy must not be considered by an ODRL Evaluator. It is created by an <code>odrl:Assigner</code> as a mere proposition.</li>
            <li>An <code>odrl:Agreement</code> policy must be considered by an ODRL Evaluator as any other <code>odrl:Set</code> policy. It represents the accord between (<i>at least</i>) one <code>odrl:Assigner</code> and a <code>odrl:Assignee</code>. An instance of <code>odrl:Agreement</code> may have a way for the <code>odrl:Assigner</code> to trace to its related <code>odrl:Offer</code>.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="sectionPermissionsProhibitionsObligations">	
        <h2>Semantics of Permission, Prohibition, and Obligation</h2>	
        <p> <!-- Relation with deontic logic -->
            The deontic modalities of permissions, prohibitions and obligations can be represented in ODRL as instances of the classes 
            <code>odrl:Permission</code>, <code>odrl:Prohibition</code> and <code>odrl:Duty</code>.
        </p>
        <p>Instances of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> may have the following different meanings in ODRL:</p>
        <ul><!-- meanings of duty -->
            <li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> is an <b>Obligation</b> of a <code>odrl:Policy</code> 
            when the <code>odrl:Policy</code> refers to it by means of the <code>odrl:obligation</code> property. 
            <!--An Obligation can be activated, violated, or fullfilled.--></li>

            <li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> represents a <b>Condition</b> for a <code>odrl:Permission</code> 
            when the <code>odrl:Permission</code> refers to it by means of the <code>odrl:duty</code> property.
            <!--When an instance of the <code>odrl:Duty</code> class is used as an activation condition of a Permission, it can be active, fulfilled or not fullfilled.
            This is a crucial difference between a Duty that represents an activation condition of a Permission and a Duty that represents an Obligation.-->
            </li>
            <li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> represents a <b>Consequence</b> for a <code>odrl:Duty</code> 
                    when the <code>odrl:Duty</code> refers to it by means of the <code>odrl:consequence</code> property. </li>
            <li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Duty</code> represents a <b>Remedy</b> for a <code>odrl:Prohibition</code> 
                    when the <code>odrl:Prohibition</code> refers to it by means of the <code>odrl:remedy</code> property. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        In addition to this:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Constraint</code> is a <b>Constraint</b> of a <code>odrl:Rule</code> when the rule 
                refers to it by means of the <code>odrl:constraint</code> property.</li> 
            <li>An instance of the class <code>odrl:Constraint</code> is a <b>Refinement</b> when an <code>odrl:Action</code>, <code>odrl:AssetCollection</code> or <code>odrl:PartyCollection</code> refers to it by means of the <code>odrl:constraint</code> property. </li>
        </ul>
        <hr/>
        <p>
            The concepts (objects) to be understood by an ODRL Evaluator therefore include: Policy, Permission, Prohibition, Obligation, Condition, Consequence, Remedy, Refinement, Constraint and State of the World. 
            Here follows a list of properties (with their possible values) needed by the ODRL Evaluator:</p>
        <ul> <!-- attributes of the main objects -->
            <li>Permission, Prohibition, and Obligation, <!-- and Condition -->	have a property called 
            <b>activation state</b>, which can take the values of <b>active</b> or <b>inactive</b>.</li>

            <li>Prohibition and Obligation <!-- and Condition --> have a property called <b>deontic state</b>, 
            which can take the values of <b>not-set</b>, or <b>violated</b>, or <b>fulfilled</b>.
            They can become violated or fulfilled only when they are active.</li>

            <li>Constraint (connected to the Rule using the odrl:constraint property) has a property called
            <b>satisfaction state</b> which can take the values of <b>satisfied</b> or <b>not-satisfied</b>. 
            A not-satisfied constraint may become satisfied and return to being not-satisfied.
            The value of the satisfaction state of a Constraint is calculated according to the <b>state of the world</b>.
            Constraints directly defined at policy level are not directly considered.</li>

            <li>Refinement (connected to an Action, to an AssetCollection, or to a PartyCollection using the 
            odrl:refinement property) has a property called <b>satisfaction state</b> 
            which can take the values of <b>satisfied</b> or <b>not-satisfied</b>.
            <ul>
		<li>In the <b>access control scenario</b>, the value of the satisfaction state of a Refinement 
            is computed according to the action that an agent <b>attempts</b> to perform on digital resources.</li>
		<li>In the <b>monitoring scenario</b>, the value of the satisfaction state of a Refinement is 
            computed according to the actual actions that are performed by the agents and that are
            represented in the <b>state of the world</b>.</li>
	   </ul>
			
            <li>Action (connected to the Rule with the odrl:action property) has a property called <b>performance state</b> 
            which initially takes the values <b>not-performed</b> and 
            can become <b>performed</b> when an action with all the properties values (i.e. <code>type</code>, 
                    <code>performer</code>, <code>object</code>,...)  that matches with the values
            described in the Rule (i.e. <code>action</code>, <code>assignee</code>, <code>target</code>) 
                    is actually performed at a given instant of time and its performance is represented 
                    in the state of the world.</li>
            </ul>

        <p> <!-- out of scope -->
            The process for computing the satisfaction state of Constraints, the satisfaction state of Refinement, 
            and the performance state of an Action is <b>left to individual implementations</b>. 
            But given these values, all ODRL Evaluators should agree on the value of the activation state and deontic states of 
            the rules.
        </p>

        <p>
            The mechanisms for computing the activation of Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations and the violation or 
            fulfillment of Prohibitions and Obligations are all different. Therefore we continue by discussing the semantics of 
            Permissions, Prohibitions, and Obligations in separated sections.
        </p>

    <section id="sectionPermissions">
        <h2>Semantics of Permission</h2> 
        <h3>Expected behaviour of the ODRL Evaluator</h3>
        <p> <!-- definition of active permission (a permission is an instance of the class <code>odrl:Permission</code>)-->
        
	A Permission can be limited by duties, like making a payment, we call these <b>Conditions</b>, and it can also be limited by <b>Constraints</b> (in time, in space, etc.). 
        In addition, the definition of the permitted action or the asset and party collection can be refined with <b>Refinements</b>. 
        The evaluation of these Conditions (duties), Constraints and Refinements determine whether the Permission is active or not.  
        In particular, a Permission is <b>active</b> if:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>all the existing constraints of the Rule are satisfied and;</li> 
            <li>all the existing conditions (duties of the Rule) are fulfilled or inactive and; </li>
            <li>only for the access control scenario: all the existing refinements of the 
            Action, AssetCollection, PartyCollection are satisfied by the attempted action.</li>
        </ol>
        <p> <!-- definition of active/inactive -->
            If the Permission is active, the action is permitted. If one of those conditions is not met, the Permission is <b>inactive</b>. When an action, which is regulated by an <b>active</b> permission is performed, the permission is used by such an action.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the <b>access control scenario</b>: when an action is <b>attempted</b>,
            if there is not an active permission that permits such an action, 
            it means that the action is not permitted and it is blocked.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the <b>monitoring scenario</b>: when an action is <b>performed</b> (and it is represented in the state of the world), 
            if there is no active permission to do so (i.e. there is no active permission regulating a class 
            of action to which the executed action belongs) and the default setting for the ODRL Evaluator
            is set to "everything is prohibited unless explicitly permitted" a violation should be generated. 
	In the following examples of permissions, as we will analyse one permission at a time, we will not deal with the 
		generation of violations for permissions.
        </p>

        <!--The life cycle of a permission is depicted in the figure below (states with the double outline are terminal states):<br>

        <h3>Evaluation of Constraints and Refinements</h3>
	<p>Please note that namespaces are used, so that <code>http://example.com/constraint/</code> is simplified by 
	"<code>constraint:</code>",  <code>http://example.com/policy/</code> is simplified by "<code>policy:</code>",  etc.</p>
	    
        <h4>Example of a constrained permission</h4>

            <b>Example description</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <!-- General description of the case --> 
            A permission may have its action limited (in time, in space, etc.) without any Condition (Duty) or Refinement.
            This is the situation of the following case, similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#constraint-rule">Example 13</a> 
            in the ODRL Information Model 2.2. The permission below allows the target asset <code>document:1234</code> to be distributed, 
            it includes the constraint that the permission may only be exercised until 2018-01-01. 
            The permission is granted by the organization <code>party:16</code>.
        </p>

            "@context": "http://www.w3.org/ns/odrl.jsonld",

        <p>
            <b>Expected behaviour of the Evaluator</b>
        </p>    
        <p>
            The ODRL Evaluator has to calculate first the activation state. The constraint must be evaluated on the state of the world, which must include a representation of the current time 
            (for example by using the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl-time/">Time Ontology in OWL</a>).  
            As long as the current time is before the first day of 2018, the Permission is active. When the first day of 2018 is passed, the Permission is inactive.
            (The activation of this type of permission does not depend on the actions attempted by the agents).
        </p>

        <i>Access control scenario:</i> 
        <ul>
            <li>(E-13-1) If the attempted action belongs to the class of actions regulated by the Permission 
            (i.e.: its <code>type</code> is <code>distribute</code> and its <code>object</code> is equal to 
            the target of the permission <code>document:1234</code>)
            and the Permission is active then the action can be executed. </li>
            <li>(E-13-2) If the attempted action belongs to the class of actions regulated by the Permission, but the 
            Permission is inactive, assuming that only this Permission is considered 
            (this is because other permissions could regulate this action), the action is blocked and it cannot be executed.</li>
            <li>If such an action does not belong to the class of actions regulated by the Permission it means that the Permission 
            is not relevant.</li>
        </ul>

            A Condition (duty) is <b>fulfilled</b> if all its constraints are satisfied and

            (For example, the duty to pay a ticket to get an active permission to enter in a museum may be active only on Sundays 
            and inactive the other days).</li>	
            <li>If the Constraints of the duty are all satisfied or there are no Constraints, then the duty is <b>active</b>.
            <li> If the Duty is <b>active</b> and its action with all refinements+properties satisfied is performed,

            The example below, similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#duty-perm">Example 22</a>  in the ODRL Information Model 2.2, is a Permission that is constrained by a Duty (which we call Condition).  The condition does not have Constraints, but its action has a refinement. In this example, the permission is granted by <code>party:sony</code> for <code>party:billie</code> to play the  
            target asset <code>music:1999</code>. The permission includes the condition to perform the compensate action that has a refinement of <code>payAmount</code> 
            of euro 5.00. The semantics of Permission requires that the compensate action (included in the duty) must be performed 
            <b>before</b> the play action in order to get an <code>active</code> permission to perform the play action.

        <p>
            The condition has to be evaluated first. The Condition <code>condition:1</code> does not have Constraints, so it is never inactive. It starts to be <b>active</b> and it is <b>fulfilled</b> 
            when in the state of the world there is a representation of an executed action that matches with the 
            the class of actions described in the duty. I.e. the <code>type</code> of the action is <code>compensate</code>, its 
            <code>payAmount</code> is equal to <code>5 euro</code>, and (given that the <code>odrl:compensatedParty</code> of 
            the <code>odrl:compensate</code> action is not specified) its <code>beneficiary</code> is the assigner of the permission 
            <code>party:sony</code>. It is not required that the agent who performs the compensate action is 
            <code>party:billie</code> because, for example, a company can pay for its employees 
            (feature for an ODRL profile: it would be useful for actions of compensation or payment to contain a reference to a policy or a rule and to 
            the party for whom they are executed).
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the condition (duty) has been evaluated, the permission can be evaluated. If the condition is active but it is not fullfilled then the Permission is inactive.
            If the ccondition is fulfilled then the Permission is active.

<h2>Semantics of Prohibitions</h2> 		

In ODRL 2.2., a Rule that belongs to the <b>odrl:Prohibition</b> class is <b>active</b> (its action, with all refinements satisfied
cannot be exercised) if all Constraints of the Rule are satisfied, otherwise it is <b>inactive</b>.<br> 

In order to evaluate if a prohibition is active, it is necessary to evaluate the satisfaction of its Constraints on the state of the world.

Duties on prohibitions have no defined meaning.<br>

An ODRL Evaluator will determine that a violation has been produced if the action regulated by an active prohibition is executed. 
If multiple actions are related to a single prohibition, the execution of a single action will result in a violation. 
The ODRL Evaluator will calculate the deontic state of an <b>active</b> prohibition to be within one of these possibilities:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>not-set</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied has not been executed; </li>
    <li> <b>violated</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied has been executed; </li>
    </ul>
A prohibition may include an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#duty-prohib"><code>odrl:remedy</code></a> for its violation. <br><br>

        <h4>Evaluation of a prohibition with constraints</h4>

            This is example is similar to <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/odrl-model/#prohibition">Example 19</a> in the Information 
            Model, with the differences that it has not a related permission and it has a Constraint. In this case, there is a prohibition that is constrained by a constraint.
            The policy below is a formal Agreement between two parties (the assigner and the assignee) that the action of archiving the specified digital asset is prohibited.
            The prohibition is specifically active only during the year 2024.

<h2>Sematics of Obligations</h2> 	

    In ODRL 2.2., an Obligation that belongs to the <code>odrl:Duty</code> class (it would be better to have an <code>odrl:Obligation</code> class) is <b>active</b> (its action,  
    with all refinements satisfied, should be perfomed) if all constraints of the Rule are satisfied, otherwise it is <b>inactive</b>.<br> 
    An active Obligation becomes:
    <ul>
    <li> <b>fulfilled</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied is executed; </li>
    <li> <b>violated</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied can no longer be executed; </li>
    <li> <b>not-set</b> when the regulated action with all refinements satisfied can be executed but has not been so far. </li>
    </ul>
    An obligation may include an <code>odrl:consequence</code> of not fulfilling that obligation. <br><br>

<h3>Documents on "formal semantics" in W3C specifications</h3>

    The W3C has produced several "Semantics" documents each of them with a different objective.

    <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-mt/">RDF1.1. Semantics</a> defines a model-theoretic semantics to determine the validity of RDF inference processes. A similar approach is followed by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-direct-semantics/">OWL Semantics</a>, a recommendation providing the direct model-theoretic semantics for OWL 2 and definingthe most common inference problems.</p>

    <p>XPath (XML Path Language) is a language that can be used to navigate through elements and attributes in an XML document, and it also has <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xquery-semantics/">formal semantics</a>. XQuery (XML Query) is a query and functional programming language to query XML data. The "XQuery and XPath Formal Semantics"  intends to complement the specification by defining the meaning of XQuery/XPath expressions with mathematical rigor; thus clarifying the intended meaning of the English specification, and ensuring that no corner cases are left out. For that regard grammar productions are given.</p>

    <p>The POWDER specification provides a mechanism to describe and discover Web resources, and it also includes a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/powder-formal/">Formal Semantics</a> document. POWDER documents are XML documents which can be automatically converted, through a GRDDL transform, into a semantically rich version in RDF (POWDER-S). The "semantics" document describes how to make such transformation. </p>

    <p>The PROV Ontology Working Group has produced 12 specifications to facilitate the interchange of provenance information in the Web (where provenance is …information about entities, activities, and people involved in producing a piece of data or thing, which can be used to form assessments about its quality, reliability or trustworthiness"). Besides having published a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/">PROVO Ontology</a> to facilitate the expression of provenance as RDF, the family of documents also define an EBNF notation "which allows serializations of PROV instances to be created in a compact manner", a set of constraints to "ensure that a PROV instance represents a consistent history of objects and their interactions that is safe to use for the purpose of logical reasoning" and statements in the PROV Data Model are seen "as atomic formulas in the sense of first-order logic […and…] the constraints and inferences specified in PROV-CONSTRAINTS as a first-order theory". 
</p> 

<h3>ODRL Formalization</h3>
    <p>ODRL was created in in the early 2000's as an XML dialect to represent rights expressions to be used in the framework of Digital Rights Management systems; and its version 1.1 gained much spread [ODRL02]. Different ODRL profiles extended the vocabulary to satisfy the needs in different sectors. In 2011, an ODRL W3C Community Group was established, publishing soon after a new version 2.1 with major changes which included a new information model [Ianella15], a vocabulary [Ianella15b] and an Ontology [McRoberts15]. ODRL 2.1 became then a policy language.Other specifications in XML and similar to ODRL were MPEG-21 Rights Expression Language [Wang94], XACML  or MPEG-21 Contracts Expression Language [Rodríguez15]. The MPEG-21 Media Contracts Ontology [Rodriguez16] defines an ontology to guide the generation of contracts as RDF, with a similar philosophy to that of the ODRL Ontology.</p>

    <p>RDF documents instantiating the "Policy" class of the ODRL Ontology or using the XML or JSON syntaxes are called simply "ODRL Policies". The ODRL Ontology is already a formalization of the ODRL information model and vocabulary. The ontology of the version 2.1 consists of 1111 axioms with low complexity, but a comprehensive definition of each element (classes and relations) and a systematic definition of domains and ranges for the properties. Some ODRL concepts are represented as SKOS concepts ordered in SKOS collection. Reasoning with the ontology would be computationally inexpensive, but the usefulness of the possible reasoning tasks with the ontology is very limited. </p>

    <p>The ODRL 2.1 Ontology is not the first ODRL Ontology and other ontologies had been proposed before [García05][Kasten10]. However, neither these ontologies nor the ODRL 2.1 Ontology directly supported any reasoning tasks of practical use. Other more generic rights ontologiesexist, claiming tocomprise the concepts of ODRL, with the ambition of facilitating interoperability. Thus, Delgado (2003) and Nadah (2007) have proposed ontologies as a bridge to make transformation between rights expression languages like ODRL and MPEG-21 REL, whereas Rodríguez (2013) underlined the similarities of seven policy languages with an ontology design pattern. Other alternative means of achieving interoperability do not require ontologies, as Guth did (2003) defining an abstract object model.</p>

    <p>Some other formalizations of ODRL have been proposed with the purpose of determining whether a request is permitted given a set of policies and a certain history of events:we can name this task as theauthorisation decision.With that purpose, Gunter and Pucella had defined general logics for rights (2001 and 2002 respectively). Pucella then extended his work to model ODRL1.1 statements (2004) as formulas in a many-sorted first-order logic with equality,to determinewhether a permission was implied by a set of ODRL statements. Holzer et al. (2004) also enriched the authorisation decision modelling the dynamic aspects of licenses with finite-automata like structures (useful when the property of an asset is transferred, or when the number of plays is limited to a certain number of times). Chong et al. (2006) modelled licenses with multiset rewritingand logic programming (Prolog), including the ability to evaluate and merge licenses and to track the dynamic aspects of the rights evolution. Barth and Mitchell (2006) observed that the authorisation decision of a sequence of actions given a set of ODRL licenses is NP-complete because of the interval constraints, and proposed using propositional linear logic to grant efficient computability. Sheppard and Sfavi(2009) defined an algorithm for the authorisation decision with some of the most common ODRL elements, giving the pseudo-code for a virtual machine. Steyskal and Polleres (2015) defined an abstract syntax for expressing ODRL policies, where the dependencies among ODRL actions and the different conflict resolution strategies were explicitly considered in the rules for taking the authorisation decision. </p>

    <p>Besides the problems of facilitating interoperability and making the authorisation decision, other problems of interest have been modeled with formalizations of ODRL. One of them is how to evaluate the compatibility and composition of licenses, useful when handling with differently licensed content or data. In this line, Gangadharan et al. (2007)proposed a matchmaking algorithm to analyze the compatibility of licenses and make license compositions; Jamkhedkarand Heileman (2008) showed how the combination of ODRL, CreativeCommons REL and the XrML (embryo of the MPEG-21 REL) licenses was possible with an abstract model and several rules. Villata and Gandon (2012) also defined a framework with algorithms to validate compatibility and to obtain composite licenses. Rotolo et al. (2013) defined a deontic logic system for the composition of licenses, with strict rules, defasible rules and defeater rules. More recent critics </p>

    <p>It is evident that some policies can be used to grant automated access to resources. For example, verifying the execution of a payment can be automatically done. However, the satisfaction of some constraints cannot be digitally evaluated. Policies then play a double role, as automatable expressions in a computer system and as constracts with a certain legal value. Steyskal and Kirrane (2015) show how to use ODRL to specify access requests, data offers and agreements, distinguishing between enforceable and non-enforceable access policies, proposing an algorithm to auto-generate contracts for the latter.</p>

    <p>In more recent efforts, de Vos et al. (2019) transforms ODRL expressions into Answer Set Programming to model policies and check compliance – specifically in the area of personal data processing, where ODRL has also been recently used (Esteves et al. 2021). Other profiles and initiatives have been proposed (Kim et al. 2020), on despite of several limitations found by Kebede at al. (2020).</p>

    <p> In Fornara and Colombetti (2019) the  ODRL 2.2 policy language has been extended in two directions. Firstly, by inserting in the model the notion of activation event, secondly, by considering the temporal aspects of obligations, permissions, and prohibitions
(e.g. expiration dates and deadlines) as part of the application independent model of policies.

            <h2>Scenarios</h2>

            <h3>Policy Monitoring</h3>
                    <p>Various autonomous agents interact in an open interaction system and perform various types of actions. 
                    These actions, with their type (e.g. a payment), various parameters (who paid, how much they paid, etc.) 
                    and the time instant at which they are done, are digitally represented in a <b>'world state'</b> or 'system state'.<br>
                    (What model of data (ontology) is used for representing the state of the world?)</p> 

                    <p>A set of ODRL policies (P) regulate the behaviour of those agents, every policy contains some rules (R) that are prohibitions, duties, or permissions.</p>

                    <p><b>Policy monitoring</b> (or compliance checking) is a continuous process that consists of computing at every instant of time:</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>the set of permissions that are valid (i.e. check if all constraints are satisfied and if all duties are fulfilled);</li>
                            <li>the set of obligations or prohibitions that are active (i.e. checking if all constraints are satisfied);</li>
                            <li>the set of active obligations or prohibitions that are fulfilled or violated by the performance of certain actions 
                                    (i.e. check if the performance of an action matches the action regulated by an <b>active</b> obligation or a <b>active</b> 
                                    prohibition taking into account all the refinements used for describing the action in the policy;</li>
                    </ul>	

                    <p>Monitoring or compliance checking are useful, for example, for being able to:</p>
                    <ul>
                            <li>Check if I am compliant with the policies in which I am involved as a debtor. For example, a company needs to check if 
                            the behaviour of its employees is compliant with the policies attached to the digital assets used inside the company.</li>
                            <li>Check if the policies in which I am involved as a creditor are violated. For example, I can attach to a picture 
                            the prohibition to sell it and I would like to automatically monitor if the actions performed on that picture are 
                            compliant with such a prohibition.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Simulation may be used by consumers for a what-if analysis and evaluate if the performance of an action on a digital asset will 
                    I violate one of its policies.<br>
                    In this scenario, it is assumed that agents are free to perform all actions, even prohibited ones. 
                    A permission is interesting when it is an exception to a prohibition.</p>

            <h3>Access Control</h3>

            <p><b>Goal:</b> Match access requests with ODRL policies determining access control to stored digital resources</p>

            <p>Access control policies can be used to determine access by users or software agents to digital resources.</p>
            <p>This is particularly important in decentralised systems where the users are the entities responsible to grant or deny 
                    access to the data and are responsible to define or adhere to a set of policies that satisfy their preferences.</p>
            <p>By using these policies in an algorithm to match incoming access requests for data, a system can provide a 
                    fine-grained access control mechanism to its users.</p>				
            <p>In this scenario, if an agent does not have permission to access certain data, it will not access the data, 
                    the prohibition is regimented and cannot be violated.</p>
            <p>Typically in this scenario, the entities responsible to grant or deny access to the data would write <code>odrl:Offer</code> policies 
                    (or new types of policies can be created, e.g., preference, requirement). The agent trying to access the data 
                    would write <code>odrl:Request</code> policies and the final agreement between the parties can be stored as an <i>odrl:Agreement</i> 
                    (associated with the <code>odrl:Offer</code> and <code>odrl:Request</code> policies).</p>

            <h3>License composition</h3>
                    <p>Two resources differently licensed ("policed") need to be integrated in a new work.
                    Which range of policies will be compatible with these two previous policies?
                    Are these two policies compatible at all?
                    The works of Governatori, Villata et al., DALICC and many others addressed this problem, but their results and ideas were never incorporated into ODRL.</p>

            <h3>Validation</h3>
                    <p>ODRL is being used in a Language Resource Data Portal. Anybody can freely upload a resource, and anybody can post ODRL policies 
                    associated to them. The ids of the content resources and the assigners are verified, but the rest is left to the users.
                    However, if they upload broken or malicious policies, they could break the system (e.g. a policy with 1 million rules).
                    How to validate the ODRL policies so that they are conformant with a limited subset of them?
                            <a href="http://odrlapi.appspot.com/">ODRL Validator and Evaluator Sandbox</a></p>

            <h3>Planning</h3>
                    <p>I want to do an action, I don't have permission to do it, what do I have to do to get permission to do it?
                    Which is the sequence of messages to be exchanged within a protocol?</p>
